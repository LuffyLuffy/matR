Description:
	Facilities are implemented to query and download from the
	Kbase MG-RAST metagenome analysis server.  Access to private data is authenticated.  
	Metadata is lightly encapsulated with data.  Import and export is enabled via an RBIOM class, 
	implemented as a close translation of the BIOM standard JSON format.  
	A suite of relevant statistical analysis routines is provided, currently focused on taxon and 
	function abundance.  This toolset is growing, supported by an active research effort.  Creation 
	of high-quality images in various formats is implemented with a Cairo graphics device; 
	rough-and-ready interactive graphics remain possible with R's default capabilities.  The package 
	imports liberally from other contributed packages, but has no strict dependencies to 
	preserve modularity of its three components (download access to MG-RAST, metagenome analysis, 
	and visualization).
