#  package BIOM.utils is a strict dependency, declared in "Depends:"
#  also (this is a separate point) methods for class "biom" are used throughout,
#  so it makes sense to import the entire package namespace.

import (BIOM.utils)

#  package MGRASTer ought not to be considered a dependency, perhaps, yet is declared in "Depends:"
#  because its environment seems to fail if not loaded this way.  (nonetheless, the
#  following namespace import might reasonably be removed, in favor of explicit references.)

import (MGRASTer)

#  all other packages are optional, each provided specific and limited analysis functionality.
#  we adopt the approach described in this remark from the (forthcoming) R-ext manual:
#    "If the intention is to give an error 
#    if the suggested package is not available, 
#    simply use e.g. rgl::plot3d."
